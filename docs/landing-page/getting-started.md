### Requirements

`SysIdentPy` requires:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- NumPy (>= 1.9.2) for numerical algorithms
- Matplotlib >= 3.3.2 for static plotting and visualizations
- Pytorch (>=1.7.1) for building NARX neural networks
- scipy (>= 1.7.0) for numerical and optimization algorithms

The library is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS. Some examples may also require additional packages like pandas.

For more details, check our [installation guide](https://sysidentpy.org/landing-page/getting-started/)

## What are the main features of SysIdentPy?

| Feature | What is this? |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NARMAX philosophy | You can build variations of NARMAX models like NARX, NAR, NARMA, NFIR, ARMA, ARX, AR, and others. |
| Model Structure Selection | Easy-to-use methods to select the best terms to build your models, including FROLS and MetaMSS and several combinations with parameter estimation techniques to select the model terms. |
| Basis Function | You can use up to 8 different basis functions to build your models. You can set linear and nonlinear basis functions and ensemble them to get custom NARMAX models. |
| Parameter Estimation | More than 15 methods to estimate the model parameters and test different structure selection scenarios. |
| Multiobjective Parameter Estimation | You can use affine information to estimate the model parameters minimizing different objective functions. |
| Model Simulation | You can reproduce results from papers easily with SimulateNARMAX class. Moreover, you can test published models with different parameter estimation methods and compare the performance. |
| Neural NARX | You can use SysIdentPy with Pytorch to create custom neural NARX models architectures which support all the optimizers and loss functions from Pytorch. |
| General Estimators | You can use estimators from packages like scikit-learn, Catboost, and many other compatible interfaces and composition tools to create NARMAX models. |

## Why does SysIdentPy exist?

SysIdentPy aims to be a free and open-source package to help the community to design NARMAX models for System Identification and TimeSeries Forecasting. More than that, be a free and robust alternative to one of the most used tools to build NARMAX models, which is the Matlab's System Identification Toolbox.

The project is actively maintained by Wilson R. L. Junior and looking for contributors.

## How do I use SysIdentPy?

The [SysIdentPy documentation](https://sysidentpy.org) includes more than 20 examples to help get you started:
- Typical "Hello World" example, for an [entry-level description of the main SysIdentPy concepts](https://sysidentpy.org/examples/basic_steps/)
- A dedicated section focusing on SysIdentPy features, like model structure selection algorithms, basis functions, parameter estimation, and more.
- A dedicated section focusing on use cases using SysIdentPy with real world datasets. Besides, there is some brief comparisons and benchmarks against other time series tools, like Prophet, Neural Prophet, ARIMA, and more.

## What is SysIdentPy

SysIdentPy is an open-source Python module for System Identification using **NARMAX** models built on top of **numpy** and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. SysIdentPy provides an easy-to-use and  flexible framework for building Dynamical Nonlinear Models for time series and dynamic systems.

## Installation

SysIdentPy is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. If not, scroll down and expand
the help box. Install with:

??? question "How to manage my projects dependencies?"

    If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading [Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies], which is a really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors.

  [Python package]: https://pypi.org/project/sysidentpy/
  [virtual environment]: https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-pip-in-a-python-virtual-environment

### with git

SysIdentPy can be used directly from [GitHub] by cloning the
repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you
want to use the very latest version:

```
git clone https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy.git
```
